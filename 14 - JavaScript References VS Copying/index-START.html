    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age, age2);
    //reassigned age will not change original age2
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // same is true for strings


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    const team4 = Array.from(players)



    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const jeff = {
      name: 'Jeff',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@jeff',
        facebook: 'jeff'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, jeff)

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'

    // will change the original object too, so you'll need to find an external function (deep clone),
    // but ask yourself first why you need to do this (go another layer deep)

    // trick
    // Poor man's version of deep clone
    
    // converts to string first then back to object and shakes off references
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jeff))
